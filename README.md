#### Game Design
This is platform jumping game for one superhero who is going through (flesh out the detail -- put this picture )
Epic explosion, and facing challenges and Rewards as he explores the tower.


#### Game Objective
Player is the hero who is in a mission to rescue different treasure from explosion.

###[Gameplay Mechanics](#gameplay-mechanics)

- Adding randomized platform and Coins
- Implementing touch events to Start the Game.
- Adding Physics and Collision and Detection so that the marine can jump to platforms collect coins;

- Implementing code to read the device accelerometer data to steer the Hero;
- Creating methods to handle the camera node so that it follows the player sprite;

- Implement code to get the fire flowing;
- Adding code to continuously repeat the background, platforms and coins;

### MVP Milestones
[The overall milestones of first playable build, core gameplay, and polish are just suggestions, plan to finish earlier if possible. The last 20% of work tends to take about as much time as the first 80% so do not slack off on your milestones!]

#### Week 1
_planing my game_
* [goals for the week]
Set up the Game play and think through the game prototype for the game. Come up with GamePlay and MockUp for the Game. 
Building up a prototype
- Adding platform 
- placing the nodes and platform overlays to set up in the scene editor.
- Game State design through GameplayKit
- Starting on the Game Mechanics and core gameplay:

#### Week 2
* [goals for the week]
Working on the Game Mechanics and core gameplay:
- Adding randomized platform 
- Adding Coins
- Implementing touch events to Start the Game.
- Adding Physics and Collision and Detection so that the marine can jump to platforms collect coins;
